# Retone AI Lite

Retone AI Lite is a lightweight web app that helps users communicate more respectfully by analyzing the **tone of a message** and flagging toxic content before it's sent.

## ➡️Features

- Detects toxic, insulting, and harmful messages in real-time
- Simple and fast web interface
- Uses Google's Perspective API for analysis
- Rewrite suggestion feature (coming soon)

## ➡️Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python (Flask), Perspective API
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages + Render

## ➡️How It Works

1. User types a message
2. Backend sends it to the Perspective API
3. Toxicity scores are returned
4. UI alerts the user if the message is harmful
